# z88dk-sym
A debugging utility to manage z88dk's *.lis and *.map files into locating symbols and line addresses

### How to install
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/desertkun/z88dk-sym
```

### Prepare your z88dk project

1. Make sure your object files (.c) are compiled with `--list --c-code-in-asm` flags. 
   Compiles should emit .lis files in the source folder by default.
   Beware that this might increase the binary footprint because of partially
   ineffective copt rules.
2. Make sure the main executable is compiled with `-gen-map-file`
   The compiler should also produce the .map file for the executable

### How to locate a line number by an absolute address

```bash
python3 -m z88dk.sym --lists="src/zx" --map bin/z4chan.map who --location 82ED
> Location 82ED points at src:_main:31
```

### Speed up the process

```
# generate the db (e.g. in a makefile)
python -m z88dk.sym --lists="src/zx" dump --dump-to db.json
# reuse the db
python -m z88dk.sym --db db.json --map bin/z4chan.map who --location 82FF
Location 82FF points at src:_main:37
```
